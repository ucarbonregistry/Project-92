_____________________________
The proposed project activity involves construction and operation of 11 Micro and Small Scale
hydel projects in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. The project activity has been essentially
conceived to generate clean energy by utilizing the hydro potential of the flowing stream. The
project is a run of the river type with minimum environmental impacts and will reduce inhabitants’
dependence on fossil fuels. This in turn will lead to reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
by an estimated 26,237 tonnes of CO2e / year during the crediting period.

Total cumulative installed capacity of the project would be 8.32 MW with an annual gross energy
generation of 29,153 MWh. These 11 Micro and Small Scale hydel projects will deliver electricity
to the villages in the vicinity, through a mix of National and Regional transmission networks and
will also supply power to different commercial customers in the region.

All the Micro and Small Scale hydel projects are being developed by Department of Hydro Power
Development (DHPD), Govt. of Arunachal Pradesh and are being managed by DHPD divisions,
which have been constituted for each project. These projects will provide energy security and will
contribute to the sustainable development of the region. There will also be significant improvement
in the quality of life of the villagers.
